# 📢 Ad Placement Strategy - Professional Integration

## 🎯 **STRATEGIC AD PLACEMENT**

I've restored and enhanced the ad placement while maintaining the professional UI design:

### **✅ AD LOCATIONS:**

1. **📍 TOP AD SPACE** - `YOUR_TOP_AD_SLOT`
   - **Location:** Between hero section and main content
   - **Styling:** Clean card with subtle background and border
   - **Purpose:** High visibility, first-impression revenue
   - **Performance:** Prime real estate for banner ads

2. **📍 SIDEBAR AD SPACE** - `YOUR_SIDEBAR_AD_SLOT` 
   - **Location:** In information column, between cost monitor and features
   - **Styling:** Matches info cards for seamless integration
   - **Purpose:** Persistent visibility during workflow
   - **Performance:** Great for vertical/square ads

3. **📍 BOTTOM AD SPACE** - `YOUR_BOTTOM_AD_SLOT`
   - **Location:** After main content, before footer
   - **Styling:** Prominent card with enhanced shadow
