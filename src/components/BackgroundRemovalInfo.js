    <h2>About Background Removal & Transparent PNGs</h2>
    <h3>What is Background Removal?</h3>
    <p>
      Background removal is the process of isolating the main subject of an image and making the rest of the image transparent. This is especially useful for product photos, profile pictures, and creative projects where you want to place your subject on any background.
    </p>
    <h3>Why Remove Backgrounds from Images?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Professional look:</strong> Transparent backgrounds make images look clean and adaptable for any use.</li>
      <li><strong>Easy design:</strong> Place your subject on any background for websites, presentations, or marketing materials.</li>
      <li><strong>Better focus:</strong> Remove distractions and highlight what matters most in your image.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How Does PixGone Work?</h3>
    <p>
      PixGone uses advanced AI models to automatically detect and remove the background from your images. Simply upload your photo, let the AI process it (which may take a few moments), and download your new PNG with a transparent background. No sign-up or software installation required.
